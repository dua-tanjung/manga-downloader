Manga Downloader
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multi Server Web Manga Downloader

This software intended to run on client computer, I'm using PHP because it's 
easy for coding and design UI. Currently I'm using PHP Desktop (Chrome) for 
running this program, it's easy to install.

- Goto https://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/wiki/DownloadChrome
- Download one package that suit your computer
- Extract to your HDD
- Replace 'www' folders contents with manga-downloader
- Create sub folder '__data' in 'www' folder.
- Run the executable file (from PHP Desktop)

Ofcourse you can use any PHP package (Xampp, Wamp, etc).
